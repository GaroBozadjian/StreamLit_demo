# StreamLit demo
IN this repo we have a demo that predicts the species of a penguine.

# penguine_model.py
in this script we cleaned and encoded the data then we fited it with Randoum Forest and saved the model to be used in the app.

# penguine_app.py
it is the app that predicts the species of the pengiune by the parameters that you give it at the sidebar.

# How to Run
streamlit run penguin_app.py
